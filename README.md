# sys-perf
Bash script for monitoring system performance. (for Linux system/server)
Run this on Linux systems for getting information on the system performance. 

Additionally, you can add the following cronjob to make it run everyday at a particular time.

>$crontab -e <br/>
>0 0 * * * /bin/bash perf.sh

The above cronjob runs once everyday at 12am. 

(Will be adding more to this.)
